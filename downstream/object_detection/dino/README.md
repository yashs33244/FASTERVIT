# FasterViT: Fast Vision Transformers with Hierarchical Attention
## Object Detection with DINO

Official PyTorch implementation of [**FasterViT: Fast Vision Transformers with Hierarchical Attention**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06189).

--- 

In this section, we present FasterViT object detection repository with [DINO: DETR with Improved DeNoising Anchor Boxes for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03605).

Please stay tuned for more pre-trained checkpoints !
